As explained in the [Primer for back-end development](/start/primer-develop-backend/) the _RAML Module Builder (RMB)_ framework can be utilised to ease development.
RAML files are also utilised in other ways
(e.g. Okapi [Web service](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#web-service) and [Tenant interface](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#tenant-interface))
and by other non-RMB modules.

Investigate the other raml-using [server-side](/source-code/#server-side) modules.
The [mod-notes](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-notes) is a compact exemplar.

The RMB README section entitled [Design the RAML files](https://github.com/folio-org/raml-module-builder#step-6-design-the-raml-files) provides some RMB-specific guidance, as well as general assistance. There is an example and commentary.

As explained there, use the shared git submodule at `ramls/raml-util`

When using RMB, it is important to further emphasise some items.
Pay attention to the "$ref" used to reference and link JSON Schema, and to the declaration in the RAML files of all schema that are used.
At this stage RAML files must have at least two endpoints.

[Use raml-cop to assess RAML, schema, and examples](/guides/raml-cop/).
A script is provided, to find files and run it.
It can also be integrated with editors.

[Reference API documentation](/reference/api/)
is automatically generated by the continuous integration,
for modules that are managed with the FOLIO CI.
