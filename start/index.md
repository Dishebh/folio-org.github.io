Take some time to become familiar. Please do not jump the gun -- it will be beneficial to have a solid understanding.
Follow at least the [background orientation](/guides/#background-orientation)
section of the [guides](/guides) to various topics.
That will introduce the resources available and the forums to enable interaction with the community.

After perusing the fundamental docs, these primers for development of [back-end](primer-develop-backend/) (server-side) and [front-end](primer-develop-frontend/) (client-side) modules will guide through the next stage.
Bearing in mind that [FOLIO uses any programming language](/guides/any-programming-language/) browse the repositories to gain insights from modules that handle similar facilities to your intention.
