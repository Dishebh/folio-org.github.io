Start with introduction to [user interface](/guides/#user-interface)
and the [client-side](/source-code/#client-side) source code repositories.

That leads to the Stripes [Documentation Roadmap](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/README.md#documentation-roadmap) and overview of the main docs, and necessary background understanding.

The foundation described in
[The Stripes Module Developer's Guide](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/doc/dev-guide.md) is necessary for developing UI modules using Stripes.

Then move on to creating a real module with the help of [stripes-cli](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-cli).

The [Regression tests for FOLIO UI](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-testing) will assist.
