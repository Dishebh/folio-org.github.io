The main set of FOLIO modules are coordinated to form a regular release.
At this stage it happens on a quarterly basis.

Each has a dedicated Slack [channel](/guidelines/which-forum/#slack)
(e.g. `#release-q4-2018`). There are various planning documents pinned there.

A typical strategy for back-end modules is to keep doing the normal work in feature branches and merging to master.
For a module that is released to be part of a quarterly release, use a longer-term [branch](/guidelines/release-procedures/#bug-fix-releases) to track the bug fixes.
So this is an anticipated bug free and "stable" branch.
