[FOLIOForums](https://www.openlibraryenvironment.org/archives/category/olfforum) are facilitated by [The Open Library Environment (OLE)](https://www.openlibraryenvironment.org) which provides notice of upcoming events and forums, and recordings of past ones.
There are details about each event and additional materials such as slide-decks.

Events are also listed at the FOLIO Trello [board](https://trello.com/b/A27ucwg8/events)
and at the [FOLIO News](https://www.folio.org/news/) page.
The latter includes the weekly project updates.

Many FOLIO recordings and presentations are available at the Open Library Foundation video YouTube
