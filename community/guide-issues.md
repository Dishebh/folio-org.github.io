title: Guidelines for FOLIO issue tracker
---

[https://issues.folio.org](https://issues.folio.org)

- Specific bugs, problems, feature requests.

- Also tasks that you know need to be done sometime later.

- If not clear whether to add a new issue, then commence a
  Discuss topic first, and later summarise into an Issue.
  See guidelines about [which forum](which-forum) to use.

- Follow up in other fora for any lengthy discussion.
  Then summarise into further issue tracker comments.
  Provide links in both directions.

## Preparing to add an issue

Describe the issue concisely in the Summary and Description fields.
Use Comments for further detail.
The Summary and Description are also utilized for reports, so detail is
better in Comments.

Use the Search facility to ensure that not already reported.

Use a local text file to prepare, then copy-and-paste.

Use attachments for long log files, text listings, and images.

## Create issue

When creating the issue, select the most relevant Project and the Issue
Type (see below).
If unsure which Project, then use "FOLIO".
If unsure which Type, then use "Task".
Someone can change these later if necessary.

After issue creation, use follow-up Comments for further detail.
Attachments can be added later.

For the "Bug" issue type, use the "Configure Fields" option to add the
"Environment" field.

Someone else will later determine the Assignee and the Priority, and will
Link between relevant issues.

## Issue types

Each Project uses a set of the following types:

- **New Feature**: Explain something new, yet to be developed.
- **Bug**: A problem which impairs or prevents proper function.
- **Task**: Something else that needs to be done.
- **Umbrella**: [TODO: Need to define this.]

## Priority levels

The priority level indicates the importance.
These are set by someone else.

- **P1**: highest priority item, drop everything else before this is resolved, reserved for critical bugfixes
- **P2**: normal priority level, must be included in the current development cycle
- **P3**: low priority level, item will be considered for inclusion in the next dev cycle
- **P4**: lowest priority level, nice-to have things that require future discussion and design

## Status

We use the following workflow:

- **Open**: Ready for the assignee to commence work on it.
- **In Progress**: Being actively worked on at the moment by the assignee.
- **Reopened**: The resolution was incorrect.
- **Closed**: Finished.

The Status does not preclude other people from assisting.
Please add relevant Comments.

## Linking

Other people will create tracker Links between relevant issues.

Using an Issue identifier within text Comments will automatically link to
it, e.g. `FOLIO-298`

Provide other relevant links, for example GitHub pull requests, and
Discuss topics.

## Filters

Various issue Filters are provided. For example, the "Added recently"
and "Updated recently" filters help to be aware of recent action.

Create your own filters. Use one as a base, then twiddle and Save As.
