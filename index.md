## Welcome to FOLIO software development

This is the home for developers building [FOLIO, a new open source library
system](https://www.folio.org/).

At the heart of FOLIO is an open source, cloud hostable, app-store based
application framework, designed to facilitate collaboration between disparate
development teams.  It is also designed to enable vendors, libraries, tenants,
and users to configure their experience to an unprecedented level. This
developer preview of the core SDK is focused on enabling a new approach to
collaborating around functions and features, in which librarians and software
developers can work together to imagine and create new kinds of library
services.

Who is the platform for at this stage?  Developers with an interest in looking
under the hood at what is coming along, or even better, developers interested
in building it with us.  We can use help testing, exploring, and stretching the
platform.  You can help us shape the core of the system.

What you will find here is not (yet) a library system, although it is steadily
accruing the features of one.  Over the coming months, we will gradually be
adding features to make this relevant to librarians and library staff, but we
have a ways to go yet.  If you would like to explore these ideas with us,
please join the conversation over at [folio.org](https://www.folio.org/).

This website brings together the documentation and links that software
developers will need to participate in FOLIO.  Though the website is still
nascent, we expect it to evolve quickly in the coming weeks.

We hope you will join FOLIO and help us shape the future of libraries!
