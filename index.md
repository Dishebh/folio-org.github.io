## Welcome to FOLIO software development

This is the home for developers building
[FOLIO, a new open source library system](https://www.folio.org/).

In addition to traditional library services, FOLIO will offer a
platform for integrating and deploying new modules which can be
developed by anyone.  Our goal is to support librarians and software
developers working together to imagine and create new kinds of library
services.

This website brings together the documentation and links that software
developers will need to participate in FOLIO.  Though the website is
still nascent, we expect it to evolve quickly in the coming weeks.

We hope you will join FOLIO and help us shape the future of libraries!
