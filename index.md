## Welcome to FOLIO software development

This is the home for developers building [FOLIO, a new open source library
system](https://www.folio.org/).

At the heart of FOLIO is an open source, cloud-based application framework,
designed to facilitate collaboration among development teams.  It is also
designed to enable vendors, libraries, tenants, and users to configure their
experience to an unprecedented level.  This developer preview of the core SDK
focuses on enabling a new approach to collaborating around functions and
features.  We see FOLIO as an "innovation platform" in which librarians and
software developers can work together to imagine and create new kinds of
library services.

Who is the platform for at this stage?  Developers with an interest in looking
under the hood at what is coming along, or even better, developers interested
in building it with us.  We can use help testing, exploring, and stretching the
platform.  You can help us shape the core of the system.

What you will find here is not (yet) a library system, though it's on its way
to becoming one.  Over the coming months, we will be releasing code and
gradually adding features.

This website brings together the documentation and links that software
developers will need to participate in FOLIO.  Though the website is still
nascent, we expect it to evolve quickly in the coming weeks.

We invite you to provide feedback, explore ideas, and join the conversation
with us over at [folio.org](https://www.folio.org/).  We hope you will join
FOLIO and help us shape the future of libraries.
