A collection of tips to assist developers to configure their local workstation setup environment for FOLIO development.

<!-- ../../okapi/doc/md2toc -l 2 -h 3 setup.md -->

Assume already doing other development, so know how to keep the operating system up-to-date, know its quirks, know how to use the various package managers. So this document will not go into detail about that.

FOLIO modules can be developed in any suitable programming language.

The [FOLIO-Sample-Modules](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-sample-modules) explains about module development.
The various [Stripes](/devguides/userinterface) documentation explains user-interface development.
Those also have more notes about setting up and managing the local development environment.
