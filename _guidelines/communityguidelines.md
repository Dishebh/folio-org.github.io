Developers need to efficiently discuss various topics such as issues,
usage quirks, new features, and documentation improvements.
Remember that other developers, the recipients of your messages, are also busy.
They also operate in different time zones. In such busy projects, items can
be easily overlooked, especially when in an inappropriate forum.

We each need to pause and consider the best forum.
There are no rules, but these guidelines can assist.

As explained in the
[collaboration tools](/guidelines/communityguidelines) section,
we have four primary fora:
[Discuss](/guidelines/discuss) (messaging forum),
[Wiki](/guidelines/wiki) (documents),
[Issues](/guidelines/issuetracker) (bug and task tracking), and
[GitHub](/guidelines/github) (source code and pull requests).

There are also secondary communication channels, including:
[Slack](/guidelines/slack) (realtime chat),
[FOLIOForums](https://www.openlibraryenvironment.org/archives/category/olfforum),
conference calls,
Twitter [@folio_lsp](https://twitter.com/folio_lsp),
and in-person meetings.
If something important occurs in a secondary channel, it must be recorded
in a primary channel.

We follow a variation of the Apache motto:
**_If it didn't happen in one of the primary communication channels
(Discuss, Wiki, Issues, and GitHub), it didn't happen._**

## General notes

- See also other notes about
  [FOLIO Communication Spaces](https://wiki.folio.org/display/COMMUNITY/FOLIO+Communication+Spaces).

- Decisions need to be recorded in an appropriate place.
  Sometimes that will be the Issue Tracker, sometimes as Discuss topics,
  sometimes it will be as a position paper on the wiki.

- Use well-chosen words for topic titles and introductory sections.
  This will make it easier to later list and search.

- Make links in each topic, e.g. between an issue tracker item and
  relevant Discuss topics. Our future selves will be thankful when
  we need to explore the reasons for a certain change.
  Note that it is also possible to copy links from the Slack archive.

- Try to search before starting a new topic. If there are duplicates,
  then link them.

- Do not expect immediate answers.

- Try to keep discussion focussed, and as close to the item as possible.
  For example, if your feedback is about a certain GitHub commit, then
  use its comment-on-commit facility.
  Likewise with pull requests and Jira issue tracker.
