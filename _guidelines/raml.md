Remember to update these if you ever change anything in the API.
And update the documentation too, of course.

For Okapi, we keep the API specs in RAML files under `okapi-core/src/main/raml/`.

For [server-side modules](/source/serverside),
the [raml](https://github.com/folio-org/raml)
repository is the master location for the traits and resource
types, while each module is the master for its own schemas, examples,
and actual RAML files.
