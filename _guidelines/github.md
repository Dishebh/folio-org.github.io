- As explained in
  [Guidelines for Contributing Code](/guidelines/index/),
  use Feature Branches for any task beyond a minor text edit.

- Use a descriptive name for the branch, with an Issue tracker number
  if relevant, e.g. "folio-293-which-forum".

- In the Pull Request, describe your main changes. Also say whether
  it is now ready to merge, or that you are seeking feedback.

- To seek feedback on your work, use additional comments on your
  Pull Request. If the specific attention of certain people is needed,
  then @mention their names.

- For specific comments on the work of other people, add comments to
  their Pull Requests or in direct response to their Commits (see
  [example](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/commit/710e201053897609ceb667e0687f830f92f9d006)).
