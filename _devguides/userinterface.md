The FOLIO user-interface toolkit is called Stripes. It is described in the
[Stripes Core README](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/blob/master/README.md),
which leads to the related documentation.

With that background understanding, see the documentation for each
[client-side](/source/clientside/)
module, especially the "ui-users".

The
[okapi-stripes](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi-stripes/blob/master/README.md)
is a special Okapi module used to generate Stripes-based UIs
for individual FOLIO tenants.
