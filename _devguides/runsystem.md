The document
[Running a complete FOLIO system](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-okapi-console/blob/master/doc/running-a-complete-system.md)
explains ways to enable a development system running the Okapi gateway,
various server-side modules, sample data, and the Stripes UI development server.
It goes on to explain another way to configure modules using the Okapi Console front-end.

Use [folio-ansible](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-ansible/blob/master/README.md)
for a quick-start FOLIO installation as a virtual machine using Vagrant and Ansible.
This also provides various pre-built "black boxes" including
"folio/stable" and "folio/testing".
The current built boxes are also available to download from
[Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/folio).
The list of module versions for each box is shown in its change-log.
