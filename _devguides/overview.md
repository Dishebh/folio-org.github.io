Documentation for the various components of FOLIO is in continuous
development. Since the system is composed of many separate components,
each component is documented individually. The best places to start are
the [FOLIO Developer's Curriculum](/tutorials/foliocurriculumintro/), which
is a series of self-paced or instructor-guided lessons, and the early chapters
of the [Okapi Guide and Reference](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md),
which describe the system as a whole and explain how the parts fit
together.

In the context of those early chapters, you may then wish to go on to:

## Community and Contribution

The [community section](/community/) explains how to be involved,
provides the contribution guidelines, lists the various collaboration tools
and has some recommendations about when to use each.

## Developer's Curriculum
The [FOLIO Developer's Curriculum](/tutorials/foliocurriculumintro/) is a series
of lessons that can be followed on your own or can form the basis of an
instructor-led workshop.

## Core Code

The most important technical document is the
[Okapi Guide and Reference](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md),
which after the introductory sections already described, goes into
detail about the Okapi API Gateway that controls a FOLIO system.
