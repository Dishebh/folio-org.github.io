The FOLIO project includes server-side and client-side platform components, and
will grow to include library services that run on the platform.  All of the
code is located in several repositories in the GitHub organization,
[folio-org](https://github.com/folio-org).  We are in the process of making
these repositories public over the next few days, and they will be linked from
this page.
