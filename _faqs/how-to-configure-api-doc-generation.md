The on-line [API documentation](/reference/api/) is automatically generated by the continuous integration system when changes are merged to master.

The configuration metadata for all raml-related back-end modules is manually managed at the [api.yml](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-org.github.io/blob/master/_data/api.yml) file.

The [Jenkinsfile](/guides/jenkinsfile/#back-end-modules) for each back-end module declares when the module is ready to publish, via its `publishAPI` parameter.

Please ensure that the module's RAMLs can be processed. The guide [Use raml-cop to assess RAML, schema, and examples](/guides/raml-cop/) will assist.
The quality of the generated documentation depends on its input.

Some RAML issues can cause the CI system to fail.
It is available to run locally by cloning [folio-tools](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-tools).

## Configuration file format

Each RAML-related repository has an entry in the [api.yml](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-org.github.io/blob/master/_data/api.yml) file.
A typical one is `mod-circulation-storage`.
To add a new entry, copy the "default" one shown at the top.

The order of entries in this file is the order of display at the [API documentation](/reference/api/).

### label

Usually an entry has one set of documents, so the `label` is null.
Otherwise use this to add a text label to distinguish each set.

### directory

The filesystem path of the directory holding the RAML files.
Relative to the top-level of the repository.
Usually this will be "ramls".

### files

The basename of the set of files to be processed.
The order is the order of display in the table.

Files that are not listed here will still be processed to generate their documentation.
However they will only be shown in the table if they are listed here, as the website documentation system needs to know.

### ramlutil

The filesystem path of the directory holding the shared "raml-util" git submodule.
Relative to the top-level of the repository.
Usually this will be "ramls/raml-util".

### excludes

The system will search for RAML files in and below the specific `directory`.
Use this field to specify directories that must not be traversed.
The default exclusions are `["raml-util", "rtypes", "traits", "node_modules"]` and the additional excludes are appended.

### version1

Set `version1` to `true` if this is known to be RAML-1.0 version.
Default is false.
This enables the API docs table to exclude the "view-2" column as explained in the [usage notes](/reference/api/#usage-notes).
