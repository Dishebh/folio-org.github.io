The on-line [API documentation](/reference/api/) is automatically generated by the continuous integration system when changes are merged to master.

The configuration metadata for all raml-related back-end modules is manually managed at the [api.yml](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-org.github.io/blob/master/_data/api.yml) file.

The Jenkinsfile for each back-end module (e.g. for [mod-notes](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-notes/blob/master/Jenkinsfile)) declares when the module is ready to publish via its `publishAPI` parameter.
