The on-line [API documentation](/reference/api/) is automatically generated by the continuous integration system when changes are merged to master.

The configuration metadata for all raml-related back-end modules is manually managed at the [api.yml](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-org.github.io/blob/master/_data/api.yml) file.

The [Jenkinsfile](/guides/jenkinsfile/#back-end-modules) for each back-end module declares when the module is ready to publish, via its `publishAPI` parameter.

Please ensure that the module's RAMLs can be processed. The guide [Use raml-cop to assess RAML, schema, and examples](/guides/raml-cop/) will assist.
The quality of the generated documentation depends on its input.

Some RAML issues can cause the CI system to fail.
It is available to run locally by cloning [folio-tools](https://github.com/folio-org/folio-tools).
