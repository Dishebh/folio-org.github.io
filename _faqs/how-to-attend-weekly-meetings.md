On specific days each week, online conference call meetings are held by the various core teams and some special interest groups.

Times are based on the [Eastern Time Zone (ET)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone).
See [world times](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?p1=43&p2=64&p3=240&p4=110&p5=69&p6=136).

We use Zoom Conferencing. Get [ready](https://support.zoom.us/) and test beforehand.

The meeting times and Zoom links for each room are listed in the [FOLIO Core Team Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/).
